all of the files in /saves will be generated automatically by the game's state and needn't be hard coded.

on the other side, all of the files in the /locs folder must be hard coded, and are the actual zone and node definitions
    note: in these files, when defining a connected node, you needn't specify the zone unless the target node isn't in the shared zone.
        properties can be defined, or not. once hard defined, they'll be added to the object.
        when loading a save file, the save will overwrite the definition.
        these values will depend on the actual object values and can be used and changed in the actual behavior definitions later.

        also, with the direction definitions, you're not limited to cardinal directions. The direction field can be named literally anything.
